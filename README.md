Communication platform for queer youth to find and share good spots.

Created at the Hack for Queer Youth.




==============
SCENARIO A
I am a youth walking in the Mission and I want to find a place to hang out for a few hours where I won't be hassled. I don't have a smartphone, but I do have a texting plan.

1. I text a phone number (TWI)-LIO-ROCKS 'find'

IF NOT VERIFIED:
2. I get a text back that says 'Do you have a verification code? Enter it or visit the SF LGBT Center to get one.'
3. I enter the verification code.
4a. I get a text back saying 'Thanks! What are you looking for? Say wifi, hang, sleep'
4b. I get a text back saying 'Sorry, that code didnt work. Check spelling and capitalization and try again.'

IF VERIFIED:
2. I get a text back that says "What are you looking for? Say 'wifi', 'hang', 'sleep'"
3. I text 'hang'
4. I get a text back that says "Where are you? Say an address or intersection."
5. I text 'harrison and embarcadero'
6a. I get a text back that says "You can hang here: [Place info, distance]. Need directions? y/n"
6b. I get a text back that says "We can't find anywhere nearby [to hang/with wifi/to sleep]."
7a. I get a text back with walking / transit directions.

==============================================
SCENARIO B
I am a youth in the outer Richmond on my friend's laptop, and I'm looking for a place to crash tonight.

1. I go to goodspot.info
2. I enter my facebook username and password

IF NOT VERIFIED:
3. "Do you have a verification code? Enter it or visit the SF LGBT Center to get one." I fill out the field for verification code.
4. Confirmation or error message.

CHECK PHONE:
5a. If they haven't yet provided a phone number, "Put in your phone number to use goodspot via text later."
5b. If they've provided a phone number, "Check this number - is it still correct?"

6. See main view. Has a map with all spots on it, plus filter controls, plus geolocate button, plus 'share a spot.'
7. I use filter map to only show places to sleep.
8. Geolocate me on the map and list spots in order, each with a 'Directions By Text' and 'Directions On Web'.

9b. I click on the Directions By Text link, and it texts me the directions.
